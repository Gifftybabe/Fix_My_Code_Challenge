DON'T PANIC!
THINGS WILL GO WRONG!

It’s Probably Your Fault
Computers try very hard to carry out your instructions and it’s very rare that the computer will have a hardware bug. If your program doesn’t work as you expect it to, it’s almost entirely going to be your fault since the computer is only carrying out exactly what your instructions tell it to do.

So, the most likely cause of the bug is that you have done something wrong in your code.

Upon reflection, this is a good thing, becuase more often than not, you can also fix it by reading your code carefully, working out how what you wrote isn’t what you really meant to write, and then correcting things.

Don’t Just Sit There, Do Something!
The usual way you’ll learn something has gone wrong is with an error message. Unfortunately, to non-programmers error messages might as well look like this:

- Clearly Define the Problem
Welcome to programming, where most of your time is spent trying to make sense of why stuff doesn’t work as you expected.

The most important aspect of this exercise is that you build up a picture of what the program was doing, why it was doing it and how it got into a state which caused it to fail.

** First I did this
** Then I did this
** Then I did this other thing
** After which I did this thing over here
** But then I couldn’t do the thing you asked so, “ValueError”
Starting at the bottom tells you what caused the failure, but you may need to read backwards to work out what led to the problem.

- Talk to the Rubber Duck
If you’re still struggling, talk to the rubber duck.


Ask for Help
So you’ve looked up the exception, checked the code, rubber ducked for ten minutes and the damn thing still won’t work properly. Now what?

Easy… just ask for help.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions - good developers are always asking questions. Knowing how to ask and what the right questions are is an essential skill to develop. Asking questions is NOT a sign you don’t know what you’re doing. To good developers it’s evidence that you’re exploring the problem and a signal that you’re engaged and interested.

So, learn to ask questions in the right sort of a way.

“It doesn’t work. What do I do?” is not going to be answered (at least in a polite way)
